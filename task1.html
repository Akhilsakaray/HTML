        <h3>INTRODUCTION TO HTML</h3>
        <p>At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements,
         which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document
         (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document 
         into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), 
         and embed content such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce the first 
        two of these and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.</p>
